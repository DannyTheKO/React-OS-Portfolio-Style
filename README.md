# My Portfolio Page Source Code
Hi I'm Danny, welcome to the source code of my website. 
If you like it, give me a **star** and feel free to copy my code.

## Priority
- Move `visibleClass` useState out of the App
- Limit user drag on resize component

## Ideal List
```markdown
- PokÃ©dex App, use PokeAPI
- Game, something easy like:
    -> Snake
    -> Tetris
    -> Xs & Os / Tic-Tac-Toe
    
-  An OS Menu Setting, change color or font 
    -> Learn how to use useContext hook
```

## Todo List
### OS Core Function
```markdown
- Draggable Function
    [X] - Draggable Component
    [ ] - Draggable Icon

[X] - Resizable Component

[X] - Open and Close Application Function

- Minimize Function
    [X] - Hide the element
    [ ] - Minimize Animation

- Maximize Function
    [ ] - Remember the current width and height before maximize
    [ ] - Set width and height using window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight

- Simulate App Focus
    [ ] - Create custom hook on using z-index component

- Popup Component (this is hard...)
    [ ] - Create new windows when user click on the image

- Notification Toast
    [ ] - Toast Success, on changing something?
    [ ] - Toast Failed, maybe failed API fetch?
    [ ] - Toast Warning, if something broke...
```

### OS Booting Simulation
```markdown
- Boot up Animation, use Async/Await
    [ ] - Wait for images to load
    [ ] - Wait for functions to load (maybe this is redundant)
    
- Login Screen
    [ ] - use PIN to access 
    [ ] - On-screen sticky note contain PIN password
```

```markdown
- Left Side: The Start Menu
    [ ] - List out all the app in the "Start" menu 
    [ ] - Open app from the listed "Start" menu
    [ ] - Focus the app if the application already opened

- Middle: Taskbar Application
    [ ] - Show application already opened in the taskbar
    [ ] - Focus application when click on the taskbar
  
- Right Side: Date/Time and Calendar
    [ ] - Fetch weather API
    [ ] - Maybe show weather in the menu ?
```

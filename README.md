# My Portfolio Page Source Code

Hi I'm Danny, welcome to the source code of my website.
If you like it, give me a **star** and feel free to copy my code.

## Priority

1. [x] Move `visibleClass` useState out of the App
2. [ ] Limit user resize component

## Ideal List

```markdown
- PokÃ©dex App, use PokeAPI
- Game, something easy like:
  -> Snake
  -> Tetris
  -> Xs & Os / Tic-Tac-Toe

- An OS Menu Setting, change color or font
  -> Learn how to use useContext hook
```
